# Coordinator progress export

Fresh fleet stock does not establish which model worker is running or when its last useful live result occurred. A progress export reads coordinator state, receipts and swarm observations without changing queue ownership or enabling work. Consumer: fleet-side ownership and idle/blocker inspection. A completed native qualification is preparation, not live game output.

Source -> local consumer -> reuse -> check: `packages/router/src/coordinator.ts` state and receipt schema, `scripts/fleet-sync.ts` fleet directory sync and `packages/core/src/fleet.ts` side routing -> `scripts/coordinator-progress.ts` side evidence -> reuse the existing queue and fleet transport -> unit fixtures for model attribution, dead or unknown owners, blocked dependencies and stale observations. The process probe checks PID existence only; it never reads command lines or credentials. A PID being alive does not prove its identity.
